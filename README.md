# Extracellular Ions and State Changes
This repository contains code and materials for the paper "Extracellular Ion Concentrations Modulate Neuronal State Transitions Governed by Chaotic Dynamics" by Rasmussen et al. (2017). 

The code implements and extends the Averaged-Neuron Model published by Tatsuki et al. (Neuron, 2016) by including intra- and extracellular ion concentration dependencies for all incorporated extrinsic- and intrinsic ion conductances. 

The code is written in Matlab, C++ and Fortran. 

%Put description here on how to use the code.. Work in progress...
