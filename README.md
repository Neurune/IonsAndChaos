# Extracellular Ions and State Changes
This repository contains code and materials for the paper "Chaotic Dynamics Mediate Brain State Transitions, Driven by Changes in Extracellular Ion Concentrations" by Rasmussen et al. (2017), Cell Systems (Cell Press). 

The code implements and extends the Averaged-Neuron Model published by Tatsuki et al. (Neuron, 2016) by including intra- and extracellular ion concentration dependencies for all incorporated extrinsic- and intrinsic ion conductances. 

The code is written in Matlab, C++ and Fortran.
