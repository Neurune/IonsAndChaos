# Extracellular Ions and State Changes
This repository contains code and materials for the paper <b>"Chaotic Dynamics Mediate Brain State Transitions, Driven by Changes in Extracellular Ion Concentrations"</b> by Rasmussen et al. (2017, Cell Systems).

<br>

The code implements and extends the Averaged-Neuron Model published by Tatsuki et al. (2016, Neuron) by including intra- and extracellular ion concentration dependencies for all incorporated extrinsic- and intrinsic ion conductances. 

The code is written in Matlab, C++ and Fortran.
